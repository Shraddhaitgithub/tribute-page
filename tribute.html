              <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
              <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b>, the former president of India, passed away on July 27, 2015. The nation remembers him every year and each time India accomplishes a feat in the area of science, especially space and missiles. While Dr APJ Abdul Kalam served as the 11th President of India, he was an instrumental force behind the development of Agni and Prithvi missiles. Dr Kalam also authored numerous books, including the famous Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds, which inspired children and adults alike to pursue their dreams.
                

In 1958, Dr Kalam joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and over a decade later, in 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). He was the project director for the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle, designed and produced in India. Dr Kalam returned to DRDO in 1982 and implemented the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program, which later earned him the famous nickname of the "Missile Man of India".
